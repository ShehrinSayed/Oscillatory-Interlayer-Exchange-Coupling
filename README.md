There is a well established quantum phenomenon typically observed in a materials stack with two ferromagnets separated by a thin metallic [27–30] or a nonmetallic [24,31] spacer.
This stack have a preferred equilibrium magnetic configuration (ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic) depending on the interlayer exchange coupling (IEC) between the two ferromagnets.
Interestingly, such an interlayer exchange coupling oscillates between the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic configurations as a function of the spacer thickness.

The IEC originates due to a quantum interference
of spin-dependent wave functions, as the majority and the
minority spins see diﬀerent barriers at the magnetic inter-
faces leading to diﬀerent spin-dependent QWs below the
equilibrium Fermi level (EF ) [32–35]. The IEC energy
periodically changes sign as a function of the spacer thick-
ness, which has been observed experimentally as a periodic
change in the magnetic configuration between AFM and
FM [24,27–31]. Such spin-dependent interference at the
magnetic interfaces is significantly reduced in the presence
of a thick oxide barrier [36,37], and the two FMs do not
have a preferential configuration at equilibrium
